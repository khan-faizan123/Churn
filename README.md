In today's competitive business environment, retaining customers is crucial for long-term success. Churn analysis is a key technique 
used to understand and reduce this customer attrition. It involves examining customer data to identify patterns and reasons behind 
customer departures. By using advanced data analytics and machine learning, businesses can predict which customers are at risk of 
leaving and understand the factors driving their decisions. This knowledge allows companies to take proactive steps to improve customer 
satisfaction and loyalty.
